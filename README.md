# bhau-2.0

bored during exams, short update to bhau.

...


took about 7-8 hours to get this up and running cause my dumb arse can't code

....


if yk js and node, you know how to install the dependencies

i still have to host it tho, will do it in a couple days

# WHAT IT DOES


bhau was made a year ago where it would randomly select a roast from a python list, and any new roasts to be added had to be manually added to the list. people usually sent me stuff that I added. 


too much work, so created a frontend where people could add roasts on their on, gets stored in a mongo collection.

still haven't hosted everything, will do it when im free
